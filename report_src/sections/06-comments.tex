% Here we provide some further tips.

% \mypar{Further general guidelines}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item For short papers, to save space, I use paragraph titles instead of
% subsections, as shown in the introduction.
% 
% \item It is generally a good idea to break sections into such smaller
% units for readability and since it helps you to (visually) structure the story.
% 
% \item The above section titles should be adapted to more precisely
% reflect what you do.
% 
% \item Each section should be started with a very
% short summary of what the reader can expect in this section. Nothing
% more awkward as when the story starts and one does not know what the
% direction is or the goal.
% 
% \item Make sure you define every acronym you use, no matter how
% convinced you are the reader knows it.
% 
% \item Always spell-check before you submit (to us in this case).
% 
% \item Be picky. When writing a paper you should always strive for very
% high quality. Many people may read it and the quality makes a big difference.
% In this class, the quality is part of the grade.
% 
% \item Conversion to pdf (latex users only): 
% 
% dvips -o conference.ps -t letter -Ppdf -G0 conference.dvi
% 
% and then
% 
% ps2pdf conference.ps
% \end{itemize}

% \mypar{Graphics} For plots that are not images {\em never} generate the bitmap formats
% jpeg, gif, bmp, tif. Use eps, which means encapsulate postscript. It is
% scalable since it is a vector graphic description of your graph. E.g.,
% from Matlab, you can export to eps.
% The format pdf is also fine for plots (you need pdflatex then), but only if the plot was never before in the format 
% jpeg, gif, bmp, tif.
